  STI Terrain
    Prairie
      Meadow	              Grass-covered area with wildflowers, often lush and open.
      Grass Field	          General grassy area, possibly more uniform, with fewer flowers.
      Shrubs	              Area with low, woody plants, often in drier or mixed-grass regions.
      Water Stream	        Flowing body of water, like a creek or small river.
      Scattered Tree	      Individual or small clusters of trees, rare but present near water or in sheltered areas.
      Rocky Outcrop	        Exposed rock formations, often found in elevated or drier regions of the prairie.
      Flower Field	        Area dominated by wildflowers, often more vibrant and colorful.
      Wet Meadow	          Seasonally wet area, damp during rainy seasons but dries out in summer, dominated by grasses and flowers.
      Marshy Field	        Permanently wet, waterlogged area with reeds, cattails, and aquatic plants.
      Pond	                Small, still body of water, supporting aquatic life and plants.
      Prairie Swale	        Low, wet area where water collects, but not flooded like a marsh.
      Prairie Sinkhole      Depressions in the land, where water collects or the ground has subsided.
      Burn Area             Area affected by fire, either recently or periodically, often with a unique ecological recovery process.

      it doesn't change its records, it's only affected by the biome's changes

      vulnerability and resistance to hazards
      placement rules
      each terrain type is affected by the season and temperature somehow, and it should have a randomization regarding the effects
      it should have a degradation and regeneration factor that affects resources and is influenced by season and temperature

Card::Source (game_id, terrain_id, type, yield)

  yield: { grass: { amount: 1, regen: 0.1, seasonal_effects: { spring: [], summer: [], autumn: [], winter: [] } } }
  season_service(summer, autumn, winter, spring) to impact yields

  { tier, sustenance, side_effects, attraction, weight, bulk, decay_rate, fungal_affinity }

  food have tier. Some castes require a certain tier. Basic, Standard, Advanced, Rare, Luxury (?)
  royal jelly is tier 5 and is produced by nurse ants. They need to consume food of tier 3 atleast in order to produce the jelly. (?)
  royal jelly requires a steady supply of high-tier food (like pollen, nectar, or sugar)
  after a food is stored, its decay is tracked by the storage itself
  If an ant eats only dry food (seeds, meat), Sustenance drains faster
  Water-rich foods prevent this loss, acting as "hydrating" foods
