  STI Terrain
    Prairie
      Meadow	              Grass-covered area with wildflowers, often lush and open.
      Grass Field	          General grassy area, possibly more uniform, with fewer flowers.
      Shrubs	              Area with low, woody plants, often in drier or mixed-grass regions.
      Water Stream	        Flowing body of water, like a creek or small river.
      Scattered Tree	      Individual or small clusters of trees, rare but present near water or in sheltered areas.
      Rocky Outcrop	        Exposed rock formations, often found in elevated or drier regions of the prairie.
      Flower Field	        Area dominated by wildflowers, often more vibrant and colorful.
      Wet Meadow	          Seasonally wet area, damp during rainy seasons but dries out in summer, dominated by grasses and flowers.
      Marshy Field	        Permanently wet, waterlogged area with reeds, cattails, and aquatic plants.
      Pond	                Small, still body of water, supporting aquatic life and plants.
      Prairie Swale	        Low, wet area where water collects, but not flooded like a marsh.
      Prairie Sinkhole      Depressions in the land, where water collects or the ground has subsided.
      Burn Area             Area affected by fire, either recently or periodically, often with a unique ecological recovery process.

  { tier, sustenance, side_effects, attraction, weight, bulk, decay_rate, fungal_affinity }

  food have tier. Some castes require a certain tier. Basic, Standard, Advanced, Rare, Luxury (?)
  royal jelly is tier 5 and is produced by nurse ants. They need to consume food of tier 3 atleast in order to produce the jelly. (?)
  royal jelly requires a steady supply of high-tier food (like pollen, nectar, or sugar)
  after a food is stored, its decay is tracked by the storage itself
  If an ant eats only dry food (seeds, meat), Sustenance drains faster
  Water-rich foods prevent this loss, acting as "hydrating" foods

Air Breather	              Dominant	Can survive in normal oxygen-rich environments.
Aquatic Breather	          Recessive	Can survive underwater indefinitely.
Toxin-Resistant Respiration	Recessive	Immune to noxious gas or sulfurous zones.
Low-Oxygen Tolerance	      Neutral	  Functions well in thin air or underground environments.
Anaerobic Burst	            Neutral	  Can perform short actions without breathing. Good for tight spaces or traps.

üåó Crepuscular (blend of diurnal and nocturnal)
Description:
Active primarily during twilight‚Äîdawn and dusk‚Äîcrepuscular creatures balance safety and efficiency, avoiding predators of both day and night.


Here are the core factors that can cause a slot to appear:

1. Queen Lineage Depth (Evolutionary Progression)
Every new Queen born adds one or more new slots, reflecting the evolutionary adaptation of the colony.

Could be fully randomized, or weighted by prior phenotype usage.

Example:

"This Queen is the 5th in the lineage. She inherited all the slots of her mother and unlocked +1 slot (randomly: weaponry)."

2. Phenotype Mastery (Specialization by use)
If a phenotype is used often and successfully (in battles, scouting, building, etc), its slot count can increase.

Maybe tracked by number of ants expressing that phenotype or successful uses of it.

Example:

"Your colony has spawned 100 ants with wings, and completed 20 flight missions. ‚Üí +1 Wing Slot unlocked."

3. Queen Mutation Event / Milestone
A random or triggered mutation can grant bonus slots.

Could be tied to game events, hazards survived, special food consumed, or ritual-like systems.

Example:

"After feeding on the flesh of a mythical beast, the Queen undergoes a mutation... She gains +1 Utility Slot."

A gene pool √© separada entre genoma da rainha e genes comidos recentemente. Para cada fen√≥tipo, √© selecionado um gene do genoma, usando aleatoriedade e domin√¢ncia.

Depois o mesmo processo de aleatoriedade e domin√¢ncia ocorre nos genes comidos, e a√≠ ocorre a soma dos genes comidos com os genes naturais da rainha.

Acho que os genes comidos deveriam ter prioridade, e n√£o ser resolvido por domin√¢ncia nessa etapa.

De acordo com algum medidor, mais genes podem ser selecionados para cada fen√≥tipo, tanto do genoma natural quanto dos genes comidos.

Al√©m disso, existem outros genes que pertencem ao fen√≥tipo Modificadores. Esses genes n√£o s√£o selecionados da mesma forma que o restante. Ap√≥s os genes de um ovo serem escolhidos, os genes modificadores s√£o selecionados usando domin√¢ncia e aleatoriedade.

Quando uma nova rainha nasce, ela vai ter os genes da m√£e + os genes comidos que ainda retem presen√ßa. Essa soma s√£o a nova gene pool dela, que ser√° considerada o genoma natural dessa rainha em sua prole. 

Sendo assim, talvez seja interessante ter alimentos que aumentem a chance de um gene espec√≠fico ser escolhido na fase de aleatoriedade.
