Gene.find_or_create_by!(name: "Phagogenesis", description: "Phagogenesis is a rare and powerful reproductive adaptation where an organism assimilates genetic material from consumed creatures. These foreign genes are integrated into its genome and passed down to offspring, enabling rapid evolutionary leaps across generations. No longer bound by the slow crawl of natural selection, species that possess phagogenesis can inherit strength, speed, cunning—or monstrosity—depending on what is devoured. This method of inheritance is unpredictable, but its potential is unmatched.", phenotype: 1, dominance: 4, effects: [])
